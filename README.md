# Mithril-n-Utils
A minecraft fabric mod, which adds new armour, ores and items. I created it not to be distributed, but for my own hardcore world to make the game a bit easier.
## Armour
Includes 4 mithril-armour pieces, which are an upgraded form of netherite armour. Wearing all pieces but the chest piece gives 20 armour points.
## Ore
The mithril-ore generates inside the bedrock layer and can only be mined, if heated up by placing lava next to it.
## Items
The ore is combined with blaze powder and a mold in a crafting grid, to create a mold of molten mithril, which can be converted to a mithril-clumb, when right-clicked into a with water filled cauldron. 4 mithril-clumbs can be combined to create a mithril ingot, which is used solely to upgrade netherite armour in the smithing table.
## Portal Calculator
This is an item, which calculates the coordinates of a nether portal in the other dimension and prints it in chat. This eliminates the need to have a calculator open while playing.
